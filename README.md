# Windows-Spotlight-Retrieval
Copies the windows 10 spotlight photos (typically seen on the lock screen) to a folder in the pictures folder
For best results you can schedule this to run as a scheduled task. 
The folder it copies it from does include assets which I've excluded. It does have two versions of the same picture. One is 1080x1920 and the other is 1920x1080. You can keep both or you may have to go in and delete the one that you don't want.
